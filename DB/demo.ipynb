      "==================================================================\n",
      "corresponding context:  1 .  In the word \"hentai\",(変態) the first kanji 'hen' refers to strangeness, and the second kanji 'tai' refers to a condition or state. \"Hentai\" was introduced in the Meiji period as a term for \"change of form\" or \"transformation\" in science and psychology. In this context, it was used to refer to disorders such as hysteria or to describe paranormal phenomena like hypnosis or telepathy. Slowly, the meaning expanded until it had the meaning of \"non-standard\". In the 1910s, it was used in sexology in the compound expression \"hentai seiyoku\" (, \"abnormal sexual desire\") and became popular within the theory of sexual deviance (\"Hentai seiyoku ron\"), published by Eiji Habuto and Jun'ichirō Sawada in 1915. In the 1920s, many publications dealt with deviant sexual desires and the Ero Guro Nansensu movement. Matsuzawa calls it a period characterized by a \"\"hentai boom\"\". In the 1930s, censorship became more common leading to fewer books being published on this theme.\n",

It was later re-released on DVD on January 13, 2004.
